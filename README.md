# Python_for_interview_preparation

Algorithms, Data structures and problem solving (for interview &amp; competitive programming)

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that can be useful for interview preparation or general programming practice. The scripts cover various topics, such as data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques.

## Scripts

Here's a list of the scripts available in this repository along with their classification:

### Data Structures

- LinkedList.py: A script that demonstrates the implementation of a singly linked list.
- Stack.py: A script that demonstrates the implementation of a stack data structure.
- Queue.py: A script that demonstrates the implementation of a queue data structure.
- PriorityQueue.py: A script that demonstrates the implementation of a priority queue data structure.

### Algorithms

- Binary_Search.py: A script that performs a binary search on a sorted array.
- Bubble_Sort.py: A script that performs bubble sort on an array.
- Insertion_Sort.py: A script that performs insertion sort on an array.
- Merge_Sort.py: A script that performs merge sort on an array.
- Quick_Sort.py: A script that performs quick sort on an array.

### Problem-Solving Techniques

- Anagram.py: A script that checks if two strings are anagrams of each other.
- Fibonacci.py: A script that generates the nth Fibonacci number recursively and iteratively.
- FizzBuzz.py: A script that prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".

## Usage

You can clone this repository to your local machine and run the scripts using Python 3. Each script is self-contained and can be executed independently. To run a script, navigate to the directory containing the script and execute the following command:

python script_name.py
