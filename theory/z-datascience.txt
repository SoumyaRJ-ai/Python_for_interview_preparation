data wrangling
	It is the Iterative process of :
	- Exploring data (Examine data for possible use case)
	- Transforming data (Structuring, normalizing, cleaning, enriching the data)
	- Validating data (Verifying quality, consistency and security of data )
	- Publishing data for meaningful analysis (Delivering wrangled result for next iterative process in the loop / downstreamed project needs)

	- Stages
		- Discovering, Structuring, Cleaning, Enriching, Validating, and Publishing data

data wrangling vs cleaning?
	- Data cleaning focuses on removing erroneous data from your data set.
	- Whereas, data-wrangling focuses on changing the data format by translating "raw" data into a more usable form.
