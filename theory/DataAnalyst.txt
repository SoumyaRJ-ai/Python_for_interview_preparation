Data cleansing and transformation
	- Format standardization
	- Parsing data and breaking it down into separate attributes (e.g., full name into first name and last name)
	- Data enrichment: bringing additional data from external sources
	- Data deduplication: remove duplicates from data
	- Data masking: sometimes you need to obfuscate data for security reasons
