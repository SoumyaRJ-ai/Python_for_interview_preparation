Authentication
	- JWT, Oauth, SAML, SSO, Token based

TLS vs mTLS
	- TLS
		- Transport Layer Security
		- One-way SSL
		- client always verifies the server certificates and the server never verifies the client certificates

	- mTLS
		- Mutual Transport Layer Security
		- two-way SSL
		- client verifies the server certificates and server verifies the client certificates.
		- Sometimes two-way SSL is also known as Mutual Authentication

SQL injection atack

Cross-Site Scripting(XSS)
	- In XSS, malicious scripts are injected into trusted websites
	- XSS attack occurs when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code,
	  in browser side script, to different user.
	- XSS attacks are two types: stored and reflected
		1) In Stored (Persistent or Type-I) XSS Attacks, injected script is permananetly
		stored on the target servers such as in a database, in a message forum,
		visitor log, comment field, etc.
		The victim then retrieves the malicious script from server when it requests
		stored information.

	xss
	XSS if you fill in a search field for example, and that variable is used
on the page somewhere, you could type in "bullshit."
"bullstit" appears in the markup. If the idiot that wrote the code doesn't
filter, limit, or otherwise sanitize that value. You could have a problem...
Dr. Evil could just type in some script ij the search field right?
<p>Your search for 'flowers <script>evil_script()</script>


Cache-control
	- It is an HTTP header used to specify browser caching policies in both client
      requests and server responses.
	- Policies include how a resource is cached, where it's cached and its maximum
	age before expiring (i.e., time to live)
