- REST
	- REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer
	- It's principles are:
		- It should be stateless
		- It should access all the resources from the server using only URI
		- It does not have inbuilt encryption
		- It does not have session
		- It uses one and only one protocol - HTTP
		- For CRUD operations, it should use HTTP methods like
			GET  - to retrieve one or more records
			POST - to create record
			PUT  - to update an existing record
			PATCH- to update a column in existing record
			DELETE- to delete a record

			HEAD - response identical to GET, but without response body
			CONNECT- establishes a tunnel to server identifier by the target resource
			OPTIONS- used to describe the communication options for the target resource.
			TRACE- performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
			PATCH- used to apply partial modifications to a resource
		- response can be JSON or XML, atom, OData etc.
		1. POST is NOT idempotent.
		2. GET, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE are idempotent.

	- REST based vs RESTFUL
		- REST based services follow some of the above principles and not all
		- RESTFUL services means it follows all the above principles.

- API Authentication
	1) HTTP Authentication
		- Basic HTTP Auth
			- where we send credentails to server, in http header. so less secure.
		- Bearer HTTP Auth
			- where we send token to server. Eg: Authorization: Bearer <Token>
		- JWT (Json Web Token)
			- It gives user-level access
			- Also, contains additional information like expiration date, user's uniqueID, ...
	2) API Keys
		- its a long unique code used to access APIs
		- used for both authentication of users and tracking usage statistics.
	3) OAuth
		- provides a way for users to grant 3rd party access to their web resources
		  without sharing their passwords.
		- oauth providers can be social logins like facebook, google, twitter, ...
		- Also, we can create using AWS Cognito

		openID - facebook, google, twitter, etc

OAuth vs JWT
============
	- OAuth 2.0 defines a protocol, i.e. specifies how tokens are transferred,
	  JWT defines a token format.
	- OAuth 2.0 and "JWT authentication" have similar appearance when it comes
	  to the (2nd) stage where the Client presents the token to the Resource Server:
	  the token is passed in a header.
	- But "JWT authentication" is not a standard and does not specify how the Client
	  obtains the token in the first place (the 1st stage).
	  That is where the perceived complexity of OAuth comes from: it also defines
	  various ways in which the Client can obtain an access token from something
	  that is called an Authorization Server.
	- So, JWT is just a token format, OAuth 2.0 is a protocol (that may use a
	  JWT as a token format).


JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
	- It is just a token format. JWT tokens are JSON encoded data structures contains
	information about issuer, subject (claims), expiration time etc.
	- It is signed for tamper proof and authenticity and it can be encrypted to
	protect the token information using symmetric or asymmetric approach.
	- JWT is simpler than SAML 1.1/2.0 and supported by all devices and it is more
	powerful than SWT(Simple Web Token).

OAuth2
	- OAuth2 solve a problem that user wants to access the data using client
	 software like browse based web apps, native mobile apps or desktop apps.
	- OAuth2 is just for authorization, client software can be authorized to
	 access the resources on-behalf of end user using access token.

OpenID Connect
	- OpenID Connect builds on top of OAuth2 and add authentication.
	- OpenID Connect add some constraint to OAuth2 like UserInfo Endpoint,
	  ID Token, discovery and dynamic registration of OpenID Connect providers
	  and session management.
	- JWT is the mandatory format for the token.

CSRF protection
	- we don't need implement the CSRF protection if you do not store token
	  in the browser's cookie.



REST features
=============
	- Performance
		— best suited for systems requiring rapid iteration and HTTP standardized verbiage,
	- Scalability
		— allows the support of large numbers of components and interactions among them,
	- Simplicity
		— REST has a uniform interface which simplifies and decouples the architecture,
	- Modifiability
		— components can be modified to fit changing needs even while the application is running.


GraphQL features
================
	- Adaptability
		— the client decides what data they want, how they want it and what format they
          want to get it in,
	- Efficiency
		— delivers exactly what the client requests without over fetching,
	- Flexibility
		— GraphQl is cross-platform and supports more than a dozen languages (Perl, Java,
          Python, PHP among others).

	- My experince
		- worked with GraphQL using AWS AppSync, and with python module, strawberry-graphql
	- Why GraphQL
		- when we give REST API, if the user is interested in part of data from, say,
		  three endpoints, then they will collective all the data and filter what they need
		- It is resource exhaustive from both serving and consuming sides.
		- If the user has the flexibility to customize the feed as per their need, then
		  we can exactly send the data, as needed.
		- That is the main reason for moving from REST API, to GraphQL

GRPC features
=============
	- Lightweight and quick system for requesting data
	- RPC functions on contracts, the negotiation is defined by the relationship
    	between the server and the client not by the architecture.
	  Most of the power relies on the client-side while handling and computations
	  are offloaded to a remote server hosting the resource.

	- lightweight
		- requires very little resources which makes it a handy solution for even
		extremely low powered situations
	- efficient
		- gPRC uses protobufs, a method of serializing structured data which focuses
		on serializing communication in an effective manner
	- open-source
	- Mainly suited for systems where requester is low power or want to preserve resources.
	- suitable for IoT devices like voice controllers, smart light switches,
	  smock alarm locks, cameras.


MicroService vs Web Service
----------------------------
	- microservice is a small, independent, application that performs a highly focused service
	  as well as possible.
	- web service is an internet-based interface that makes the "services" of one application
	  available to applications running on different platforms.
