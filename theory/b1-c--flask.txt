flask
=====
With flask,
	I worked on creating both Web Applications and REST APIs.

	Used Blueprints to modularize the code for each resource in the API
	Used ORM libraries like SQLAlchemy to interface with databases
		and Albemenic for Database migrations
	Worked with multiple extensions like

		Flask-SQLAlchemy - This extension provides support for SQLAlchemy, a popular ORM library.
		Flask-WTF - This extension provides support for WTForms, a popular form library.
		Flask-Mail - This extension provides support for sending email.
		Flask-RESTful - This extension provides support for creating RESTful APIs.
		Flask-Uploads - This extension provides support for uploading files.
		Flask-DebugToolbar - This extension provides a debugging toolbar for Flask applications.
		Flask-Login - This extension provides support for user login and logout.
		Flask-Security - This extension provides a more comprehensive security framework for Flask applications.
		Flask-Caching - This extension provides support for caching data in memory or on disk.

		Flask-JWT for authentication and authorization
		Flask-SQLAlchemy - Provides ORM database layer to allow interacting with SQL databases like SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, etc. Very commonly used for database models and queries.
		Flask-Migrate - Handles SQLAlchemy database migrations and schema changes in Flask apps using Alembic. Useful during development and deployment.
		Flask-Login - Manages user authentication, sessions and protects views. Quick way to add login/logout to apps.
		Flask-WTF - Integration with WTForms for form validation and CSRF protection. Useful for building web forms.
		Flask-RESTful - Provides tools for building REST APIs with Flask including request parsing and response generation.
		Flask-JWT - Adds JSON web token support for stateless authentication of REST APIs. Useful for mobile or AJAX apps.
		Flask-Mail - Makes sending transactional emails from Flask apps easy such as account confirmation emails.
		Flask-Cache - Adds caching support to Flask for performance gains. Supports simple and memcache types.
		Flask-Bootstrap - Quick way to integrate Bootstrap frontend styling for templates.
		Flask-DebugToolbar - Provides a debugging toolbar with useful runtime info like performance stats, routes, logs etc.


In production, instead of app.run, we use
	gunicorn --worker-class gevent --workers 8 --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 wsgi:app --max-requests 10000 --timeout 5 --keep-alive 5 --log-level info


Production app
	- https://www.toptal.com/flask/flask-production-recipes

Flask
	- Sqlachemy with Alembic for database migrations


Flask vs FastAPI
	- Compared to flask, fastapi comes with builtin features like
		- automatic documentation
		- By default, error message will be in JSON format
		- Asynchronous support and ASGI implementation

	Recently flask also started async support.
	Also, flask has a large community support.


In Flask,
	I worked from as basic as a small flask app, to flask-restplus REST APIs.

	For Authentication, i worked with Flask-OIDC when working with SSO, to
		Flask-JWT when working with JWT, and
		Flask-OAuthlib when working with Oauth
		Flask-Social for integrating social media accounts such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.

	For Serialization, worked with Marshmallow

	For ORM, worked wih Sqlachemy
