flask
=====
In production, instead of app.run, we use
	gunicorn --worker-class gevent --workers 8 --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 wsgi:app --max-requests 10000 --timeout 5 --keep-alive 5 --log-level info


Production app

Flask
	- Sqlachemy with Alembic for database migrations


Flask vs FastAPI
	- Compared to flask, fastapi comes with builtin features like
		- automatic documentation
		- By default, error message will be in JSON format
		- Asynchronous support and ASGI implementation

	Recently flask also started async support.
	Also, flask has a large community support.


In Flask, 
	I worked from as basic as a small flask app, to flask-restplus REST APIs.
	
	For Authentication, i worked with Flask-OIDC when working with SSO, to
		Flask-JWT when working with JWT, and 
		Flask-OAuthlib when working with Oauth
		Flask-Social for integrating social media accounts such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.
	
	For Serialization, worked with Marshmallow
	
	For ORM, worked wih Sqlachemy
