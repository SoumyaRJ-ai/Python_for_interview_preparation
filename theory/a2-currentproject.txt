Current Project is into data analytics
We have a couple of data scientists, who will drive this data analytics process.

my responsibilities here include
	- data gathering from both internal and external data sources
		- including REST APIs, SOAP interfaces, GRAPHQL, and internal databases
	- also, writing scripts for etl jobs, data transformations, and for the
	  business logic
	- finally, the cleansed and transformed data will be exposed as an API, for both
		UI consumption and for app to app communication

	50% time for coding
	10% time for testing
	10% time for code review
	Remaining – client and Stakeholder discussions, agile ceremonies

	When we started this project, we are just two members in the team.
	I am part of initial design discussions, dataflow design, db design, creating JIRAs,
	implementing, demoing the clients, and finally shipping of product.

	we initially started on small POC, after approvals got budgets for team expansion,
	and created an MVP product, and then stable releases.


In Machine Learning,
	I worked with a Linear regression algorithm, using the scikit-learn module.
	The use-case is that there was an archive database.
	We need to do future predictions based on these past values.

	I created a model and also exposed it via a flask application, for further training.

In terms of technical stack,
	Our application server is in a EC2 instance, and celery workers are running
	on another server.
	Both are in multiple regions for DR (disaster recovery) strategy.

	Which is behind the autoscaling and inturn, behind the Route53

	All my data feeds and ETL jobs are microservices written in either aws lambda,
	or aws step functions; or recently, with container based microservices
	Used docker for containerization and kubernetes for orchestration.

    Project Stack
    --------------
    Frontend    : Django Template Language(DTL), Jinja, Javascript, jQuery, D3.js, Aggrid
    Backend     : Django, Django Rest Framework (DRF)
    Cache       : Redis
    Queuing     : RabbitMQ
    Scheduler   : Celery

In terms of team,
	In backend, apart from me, there were two junior developers
	In frontend, two developers were present
	And we have a couple of data scientists, who will architect the dataflows
------------------------------------------------------
In AWS cloud, my roles involve,
	I will create the architecture,
	We will implement using the cloud formation templates
	And integrate with ci/cd

	We will do POCs with new components in aws, and if success, we try to incorporate in architecture,
	using cloud formation templates

Day-to-day activities
--------------------
- on a daily basis,
	Initially when I start I will check for any emails or alerts which we need to address.
	So, and if I need to reach out any stakeholders I will reach out to them And then like I
	started working on my JIRAs And after the stand up during the stand up like you know, so
	we discuss on what are the pain points or any you know blockers Then finally, so after
	the, you know, the standup like I will start working on my JIRAs.
- We prioritize based on the situation and sometimes, i will take manager’s decision

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In terms of the technical stack,
	we have a web application written in Django, with frontend as React
	This web application is a monolithic architecture

	For the data collections, transformations and business logic,
	I worked on creating multiple microservices with AWS Lambda
		I created data pipelines with s3 bucket to aws lambda with time and event triggers
		Also, exposed lambdas with API Gateway for other teams, for data infusion to my db

Current Project - Fault-analysis for medical devices @ Medtronic
-----------------------------------------------------------------
	- We are into medical devices manufacturing and servicing
	- we collect the anonymous data from medical devices, and store in mongodb
	- we do post-analysis on this archival data.


Current Project - Bank of America - Financial transactions analysis
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	 - WallMart can store all the financial transactions
	 - But for small organization, for capturing their transactions for post analysis
	 - we are here for that transaction capturing.


Current Project - T-Mobile
-------------------------------
	- I am part of a team which will create cellular propagation models.
	- Means for cellular call drop analysis


Current Project - Fault-analysis project
------------------------------------------
	- At Denso, we sell vehicle spare parts

	we sell vehicle spare parts, and some of the products will send back some
	anonymous data back to our servers.

Current Project - Customer Behavious Analytics project
------------------------------------------
	- I am part of customer behaviour analytics teams.
	- If you come to our website, you will notice some cookies.
	- These cookies will send the user-analytics data feeds, back to
	  our databases.
	- We analyse those offline data, and bring insights from them.
	- These results will be used in different domains, within the organization.


Current project - Mortgage analytics
-----------------------------------
	- we have mortgage products.
	- I am here, part of the R&D team, doing research on these products and their
	  enhancements.

Current project - RealEstate
------------------------------
	- CBRE works in Real-Estate market
	- I am part of the planning department.
	- Our team is responsible for giving the prediction, for better planning
	- We collect data from different sources like climate info, crop yield, agriculture growth,
	  geographic and geological informations

Current Project - Medical Research Analytics
