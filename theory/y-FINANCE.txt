Debentures
==========
	- bondholders will receive a fixed amount of interest each year until the debenture matures.

	- Maturity:
		- Bonds typically have a shorter maturity than debentures.
		- Bond holders get their investment back sooner than debenture holders.

	- Risk:
		- Bonds are typically considered to be less risky than debentures, as bond holders have a claim on the company's assets.

primary market debentures
-------------------------
	- new securities are issued for the first time
	- companies, governments, or other entities issue debentures to raise money.
	- less liquid than the secondary market, as there will be fewer buyers and sellers in the primary market.
	- Features
		Issuer		: company, government, or other entity that is issuing the debenture.
		Underwriter	: The underwriter is the financial institution that is responsible for selling the debentures to investors.
		Pricing		: The price of a debenture is determined by the underwriter based on a number of factors, including the creditworthiness of the issuer, the interest rate environment, and the demand for debentures.
		Proceeds	: The proceeds from the sale of debentures are used by the issuer to raise money.

	- Benefits
		- New issue premium:
			- Investors who buy debentures in the primary market may be able to get a new issue premium, which is a premium above the face value of the debenture.
		- Access to new investment opportunities:
			- The primary market provides investors with access to new investment opportunities that may not be available in the secondary market.
		- Supporting the issuer:
			- By investing in debentures in the primary market, investors are helping to support the issuer and its growth.

	- Risks
		Illiquidity:
			- The primary market for debentures is typically less liquid than the secondary market, which means that it may be difficult to sell debentures in the primary market.
		Risk of default:
			- issuer of a debenture may default on debenture, which means that investors may not be repaid their investment.
		Interest rate risk:
			- If interest rates rise, the value of debentures may fall

role of front desk person for primary market debentures
--------------------------------------------------------
	- to facilitate the issuance of new debentures
	- Providing information to investors about the debentures that are being issued, such as
		- the terms of the debentures,
		- the creditworthiness of the issuer, and
		- the interest rate environment
	- Accepting orders from investors, who want to buy debentures.
	- Processing orders from investors, which includes verifying the identity of the investors, ensuring that the orders are filled, and sending confirmations to the investors.
	- Monitoring the market for debentures, which includes tracking the price of debentures, the demand for debentures, and the creditworthiness of the issuers.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Value at Risk (VaR)
	-  risk management metric that quantifies potential loss of an investment or portfolio over a specific time horizon, at a certain level of confidence
	-  estimates the maximum loss that an investment is likely to experience under normal market conditions over a given time period and with a specified probability

	- VAR is determined by three variables:
		1) period,
		2) confidence level, and
		3) the size of the possible loss.
	- There are three methods of calculating Value at Risk (VaR) including
		1) the historical method,
		2) the variance-covariance method, and
		3) the Monte Carlo simulation.

	- WHY VAR
		- It will address questions like:
			1) What can I expect to lose in dollars with a 95% or 99% level of confidence next month?
			2) What is the maximum percentage I can expect to lose with 95% or 99% confidence over the next year?

Risk-Adjusted Return (RAR)
	- calculates the returns earned, relative to the volatility.
	- A steadier return means low volatility and hence a high RAR

	- Formula is
		RAR = CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate) Return on portfolio / Volatility (Standard deviation of returns)

	- For example you will be happier to see a cricketer who scored 50, 50, 60, 40, 50 in 5 is innings in a row rather
	  than one who scores 0, 200, 0, 0, 50 - even though both have the same average.

Gain to Pain ratio:
	- This captures the pain (or the drawdowns) lived through to get the returns.
	- It is defined as the sum of all monthly returns (positive and negative) divided by the sum of the quantum of all monthly negative returns/ drawdowns.

	- Formula is
		Gain to Pain Ratio = Total Returns/ Absolute value of negative returns


Liquidity Management(LM), for Payments
=======================================
 - Practice of managing cash, including assets that can easily be converted to cash
	- Individual
		- Monthly Income, Investments, Outgoing payments
	- Corporations
		- Accounts - Cash, assets
		- Single or multiple currencies
		- Single region or multiple regions or jurisdictions

- Tools for LM
	- Credit Interest
	- Overdraft  - line of credit - shortter - higher interest - given on overnight basis
	- Daylight overdrafts (or) Intraday credit limits
		- Movement of funds in and out of an account - on an intraday basis
	- ZBAs - Zero Balance Accounts
		- Regular current accounts from which the account holder can make/receive payments
		- It's a subaccount created as part of a grouping of accounts, often to segregate different types of payment activity, generally to ease the reconciliation process.
		- Under one Master accounts, there will be multiple ZBAs, created for different types of businesses, of a company
	- Sweep Structures
		- Like ZBA structure, but balance need not be zero at the end of each processing day
		- customer can leave a specified amount in the account that is being 'swept', called a TARGET BALANCE.
		- In auto-sweep, not necessary to move funds from one account to other on daily basis, instead at intervals such as weeky/monthly or at target balance. But customer can make funds movement request outside auto schedule absed on his/her needs.
		- Used by both corporations or individual retail clients
		- Two-way sweep
			- process of moving funds from one account to another and then back again, usually at pre-agreed intervals
	- Notional Pooling
		- surplus balances in one account are OFFSET by overdrawn positions in another account without physically moving funds between accounts
		- Interest is paid/charged on net balance of all accounts in notional pool
		- No Physical movement of funds between accounts
		- Not Allowed in all countries (ex: US, JAPAN only ZBA/Sweep structure)
		- Also, there can be Multi-currency notional pooling
	- POBO (pay on behalf of) & ROBO (receive on behalf of)
		- All of subsidiaries within a legal entity give permission for one enity to make all of its payments and accept all of its receipts.
		- Greter efficiencies for cutomers, leading to cost savings
		- POBO
			- A scheme whereby one legal entity allows another legal entity within a group of companies to make their payments
		- ROBO
			- A scheme whereby one legal entity allows another legal entity within a group of companies to receive their payments


- Strategies for liquidity management may include:

	a. Cash Flow Forecasting:
		- Predicting incoming and outgoing cash flows to anticipate potential shortfalls or surpluses in liquidity.

	b. Cash Reserves:
		- Maintaining a prudent level of cash reserves or cash equivalents to handle unforeseen events or emergencies.

	c. Working Capital Management:
		- Optimizing the management of current assets (e.g., accounts receivable, inventory) and current liabilities (e.g., accounts payable) to ensure smooth operations.

	d. Short-Term Borrowing:
		- Utilizing short-term borrowing facilities, such as lines of credit or overdrafts, to cover temporary cash shortfalls.

	e. Investment of Surplus Funds:
		- Investing excess cash in low-risk, short-term instruments to earn some return while remaining readily available for use.
