Debt vs Equity
==============
 - "Debt" involves borrowing money to be repaid, plus interest, while "equity" involves raising money by selling interests in the company


preferred shares
	- Preference shares/stock, are shares of a company's stock with dividends that are paid out to shareholders before common stock dividends are issued.
	- If the company enters bankruptcy, preferred stockholders are entitled to be paid from company assets before common stockholders.

Common shares
	- Common shares are issued to business owners and other investors as proof of the money they have paid into a company.
	- Of all shareholders, common shareholders have the least claim on a company's assets.

Shares in a limited company
	1) Ordinary shares.
	2) Non-voting shares.
	3) Preference shares.
	4) Redeemable shares.


VAR
	- Value at Risk (VaR) is a statistic that is used in risk management to predict the greatest possible losses over a specific time frame.
	- VAR is determined by three variables:
		1) period,
		2) confidence level, and
		3) the size of the possible loss.
	- There are three methods of calculating Value at Risk (VaR) including
		1) the historical method,
		2) the variance-covariance method, and
		3) the Monte Carlo simulation.

	- WHY VAR
		- It will address questions like:
			1) What can I expect to lose in dollars with a 95% or 99% level of confidence next month?
			2) What is the maximum percentage I can expect to lose with 95% or 99% confidence over the next year?
