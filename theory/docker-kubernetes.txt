Docker
======
- Use cases
	- Simplifying configuration
	- App isolation
	- server consolidation
	- multi-tenancy
	- code pipeline management
	- Rapid Deployment
	- Developer productivity
	- Debugging capabilities

- Commands
	1. `docker ps`  # current containers
	2. `docker run` # create and start the container
	3. `docker create` # create container
	4. `dokcer exec` # to run commnads in container for once
	5. `docker stop [container ID]` # terminate the container and save it's state by commit it
	6. `docker rm [container ID]` # remove container
	7. `docker inspect [container ID]` # Get more info about running container
	___
	7. `docker images` # list the images
	8. `docker push` # push your image to docker repo
	9. `docker pull` # download an image from docker repo
	10. `docker commit` # create an image from container
	11. `docker rmi` # remove image
	___
	12. `docker volume` # create a docker volume
	13. `docker network` # create a docker network
	14. `docker build` # build a new image from dockerfile

			docker build -t imageName:imageTag pathToDockerfileDirectory/

			Example:
			docker build -t vieux/apache:2.0

- docker.yaml

	FROM python:3.6

	# Create app directory
	WORKDIR /app

	# Install app dependencies
	COPY src/requirements.txt ./

	RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

	# Bundle app source
	COPY src /app

	EXPOSE 8080
	CMD [ "python", "server.py" ]

- runnning docker container
	$ cd python-docker
	$ docker build -t python-docker-dev .
	$ docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 python-docker-dev

- Kubernetes
	-  Ingress
		- An object that allows access to your Kubernetes services from outside the Kubernetes cluster.
		- we can configure access by creating a collection of rules that define which inbound connections reach which services.
		- Ingress traffic is composed of all the data communications and network traffic originating from external networks and destined for a node in the host network. Ingress traffic can be any form of traffic whose source lies in an external network and whose destination resides inside the host network.
