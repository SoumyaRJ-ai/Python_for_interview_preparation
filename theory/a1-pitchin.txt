Thank you for the briefing. Now, I can understand more about the position.
After listening to the conversation, I am more confident to say that, “I am best fit for this role”

INTRODUCTION:
-------------
I am a Full-Stack Python Developer, with all years of experience, with around 80% into Backend work and 20% into the frontend.

IN Backend, I worked on creating standalone scripts for automation, scheduled jobs,
ETL jobs and data pipelines; and RESTful APIs and web applications.

IN FRONTEND, I worked on creating dashboards/graphs/charts using d3.js or high charts libraries,
and tables using ag-grid. Also, worked on JavaScript, jQuery, and react.

In databases,
- In relational dB, I worked with MySQL, MS SQL, oracle dB and PostgreSQL.
- In no-relational dB, I worked with MongoDB and Cassandra.
- In data warehousing, I worked with Snowflake schema

In Python,
- worked on creating web applications and RESTFUL APIs using Django/flask/FastAPI frameworks
- Also, worked on creating process automation and integrating with infrastructure(Linux/windows) boxes.
- Apart from these, I also worked on data gathering from
	1) structured datasources like REST APIs (internal or external), databases, etc.
	2) unstructured datasources like web scraping using beautiful soup
	3) Also, worked on structured, semi-structured or unstructured file types like csv, excel, json, yaml, parquet, etc.
- As part of projects, I followed TDD (test driven development).
	So, created unit tests and integration tests for the source code, using either unittest or pytest modules.

In Caching,
- I worked with Redis

In scheduling,
- I worked with celery.
- I did integrations with django applications for periodic jobs

In Public Cloud, I am mostly associated with AWS Cloud.
In AWS Cloud, I worked with
	Server-based Architectures with
		- EC2 Instances
		- Elastic Load balancer
		- Auto-Scaling
		- Route53

	for Storage,
		- s3 bucket for file storage
		- s3 Glacier for Archival Storage

	Server-less Architectures with
		- AWS Lambda - with either time-triggered or event triggered
		- AWS API Gateway with http-triggered

		AWS Event Scheduler for scheduling the lambda

	For oauth, I worked with aws cognito
	- Also, worked with SQS, SNS and SES
	- And, EMR cluster for Pyspark
	- for the ETLs, I worked with AWS Glue Jobs with DataCatalog and Pyspark

Also, have experience in creating the CI/CD setup using Jenkins and Groovy script.

And, I have experience in agile methodologies like Scrum, Kanban in facilitating agile ceremonies like daily
standups,sprint reviews, plannings and restrospectives. I am familiar with Agile tools like Jira and skilled
in working with cross-functional teams including Dev team, QA testers, and PM/PO's.

In Golang, I created microservices and ETL jobs,
	Mainly using go concurrency.
	Used Gokit for microservices implementation,
	and Cobra package for creating command line utilities.
	GORM - for working with the databases
	BDD with ginko framework
	Learning the GRPC

REASON FOR CHANGE -
	CONTRACT COMPLETED. NO more SCOPE FOR EXTENSION.
	SO, Looking for a change.
	But It is a very interesting project.

	Recently, our company made a policy change to make work from office mandatory.
	It is becoming difficult to commute daily to office, and manage my recently born baby boy.
	Also, my spouse is worried about any potential covid outbreak again.
	So, I am looking for remote role, as I did the same from outbreak of COVID onwards.

Rate yourself
	For Python, I would say 9/10
	For SQL, I would count as 8/10, I didnt work in managing databases, only as a developer
			I did create db design, complex queries, joins, sql procs/functions/db triggers, etc

how do you learn new technologies, and trends
=============================================
	- I subscribed to various blogs and weekly newsletters
	- Apart from them, I go through the stackoverflow questions and workplace stackoverflow questions, in my free time.
	- And, part of enhancements or POCs, I research and read, and sometimes implement, based on some articles
	- sometimes, I will listen to some tech related podcasts.

Python Podcasts
================
	- TalkPython.fm

Python Books
=============
Learning Python by Mark Lutz
Python Distilled by David Beazley

People in Python community
==========================
	- Sam Lau and Philip Guo, who built the pythontutor and pandastutor websites

Learning new language
======================
	I'm very much interested in learning a new language.
	One receent example I would like to quote is
	There is an old legacy application, from which we were given access to get information, within a specific window of time.
	So, I tried using python muti-threading/multi-processing combination, but I wasnt satisfied with the outcome.
	When researched, I found that Go language is better suitable for concurrent microservice calls, and worked on it.

	With this I want to say like you I'm pretty much flexible enough to learn a new language and adapt.

When Programming started
========================
I am interested in playing online games.
When I am in my graduation, hope you remember, angry birds
became a big hit.

I played different games, but this is simple.
So, I thought of creating one.
When researched, I found some code online.
I just created a clone for it. Added some changes, for fun.
I worked with pygame, which is a python module.

Then, when looking for job, as i have some knowledge in python,
I looked for work in it, and landed as a python developer.
That is my journey

===========================================================================================================
I have 6+ years of experience in the IT industry as a Python developer.
Currently working with Capital one we mainly focus on providing a better customer experience.
I played the role of both a python developer & frontend developer.

Hands-on experience in Python and front-end technologies, HTML, CSS, JS, Angular, Bootstrap, React Js,
Node.js and AWS, databases like PostgreSQL, Teradata, MySQL, Dynamo DB


My responsibilities included building key services such as data scraping from various sources and
creating a browser extension using python. I also make sure to work in a TDD environment, where I
write test cases for each service I developed.

In terms of APIs, I was involved in building multiple endpoints to scale our application and we
used AWS API Gateway to handle API requests and responses. To analyze our user data, I used the
pandas and NumPy libraries, and we used AWS Glue to extract data from our S3 data lake and create metadata.

Additionally, we used AWS Quick Sight for real-time metrics and data visualization.
All of this allowed us to quickly analyze customer data and provide relevant recommendations to our credit card holders.
