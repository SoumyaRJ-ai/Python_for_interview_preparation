IN Backend, I worked on creating standalone scripts for automation, scheduled jobs,
ETL jobs and data pipelines; and RESTful APIs and web applications.

IN FRONTEND, I worked on creating dashboards/graphs/charts using d3.js or high charts libraries,
and tables using ag-grid. Also, worked on JavaScript, jQuery, and react.

In databases,
- In relational dB, I worked with MySQL, MS SQL, oracle dB and PostgreSQL.
- In no-relational dB, I worked with MongoDB and Cassandra.
- In data warehousing, I worked with Snowflake schema

In Python,
- worked on creating web applications and RESTFUL APIs using Django/flask/FastAPI frameworks
- worked on creating process automation and integrating with infrastructure(Linux/windows) boxes
- worked on web scraping using beautiful soup
- created unit test, integration test for the source code, using unittest and pytest modules

In Caching,
- I worked with Redis

In scheduling,
- I worked with celery.
- I did integrations with django applications for periodic jobs

In Public Cloud, I am mostly associated with AWS Cloud.
In AWS Cloud, I worked with
	Server-based Architectures with
		- EC2 Instances
		- Elastic Load balancer
		- Auto-Scaling
		- Route53

	for Storage,
		- s3 bucket for file storage
		- s3 Glacier for Archival Storage

	Server-less Architectures with
		- AWS Lambda - with either time-triggered or event triggered
		- AWS API Gateway with http-triggered

	For oauth, i worked with aws cognito
	- Also, worked with SQS, SNS and SES
	- And, EMR cluster for Pyspark
	- for the ETLs, I worked with AWS Glue Jobs with DataCatalog and Pyspark

Also, In the current project, I created the CI/CD setup using Jenkins and Groovy script.

In Golang, I created microservices and ETL jobs,
	Mainly using go concurrency.
	Used Gokit for microservices implementation,
	and Cobra package for creating command line utilities.
	GORM - for working with the databases
	BDD with ginko framework
	Learning the GRPC

REASON FOR CHANGE -
	CONTRACT COMPLETED. NO more SCOPE FOR EXTENSION.
	SO, Looking for a change.
	But It is a very interesting project.


how do you learn new technologies, and trends
=============================================
	- I subscribed to various blogs and weekly newsletters
	- Apart from them, i go through the stackoverflow questions and workplace stackoverflow questions, in my free time.
	- And, part of enhancements or POCs, i research and read, and sometimes implement, based on some articles
	- sometimes, i will listen to some  tech related podcasts.

Python Podcasts
================
	- TalkPython.fm

Python Books
=============
Learning Python by Mark Lutz
Python Distilled by David Beazley

People in Python community
==========================
	- Sam Lau and Philip Guo, who build the pythontutor and pandastutor websites


When Programming started
========================
I am interested in playing online games.
When I am in my graduation, hope you remember, angry birds
became a big hit.

I played different games, but this is simple.
So, I thought of creating one.
When researched, I found some code online.
I, just, created clone for it. Added some changes, for fun.
I worked with pygame, which is a python module.

Then, when looking for job, as i have some knowledge in python,
I looked for work in it, and landed as a python developer.
That is my journey

We have Built micro services for different use cases with Rest APIs using aws api gateway and Lambda and
integrated these APIs with several components to get, post, delete info from the database.

Created IAM role based services that can access aws s3, dynamodb for data storage.

Worked on aws EMR clusters with python, spark to move large data from different sources, transform and
load into mongodb and cloud databases like auroradb/datalake s3.

Used Django and python to build an application which shows the data movement statistics and related graphs.

hands-on experience using Python in developing data-based applications,



Reading the unstructured large text files (around 70 Gigabytes each from external vendor) into Pyspark DataFrames,
 cleaning the data and making it structured and storing it in Amazon S3 to use it for further processes.

Worked on high configuration EMR cluster to run Spark jobs and created bootstrap scripts to install additional
 applications required on the EMR cluster.

Based on the new or updated business requirements, redesigned and implemented the Rules for Processing Workflows.

Analyzing existing applications consisting of multiple batch programs in SAS and developed the code in Python and Spark.

Built new connections to databases like ORE, Snowflake, Redshift, and Teradata from spark and python and
incorporated everything in a python library to make the DA's life easier.
