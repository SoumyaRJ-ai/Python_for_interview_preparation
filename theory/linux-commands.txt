LIMITS
======
- open Files Max limit
	cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max


ulimit -n  	–> It will display number of open files limit
ulimit -c 	–> It display the size of core file
umilit -u 	–> It will display the maximum user process limit for the logged in user.
ulimit -f 	–> It will display the maximum file size that the user can have.
umilit -m 	–> It will display the maximum memory size for logged in user.
ulimit -v 	–> It will display the maximum memory size limit

ulimit -Hn 	-> It wil display hard limit for number of open file for logged in user
ulimit -Sn 	-> It wil display soft limit for number of open file for logged in user

To increase limit on number of Maximum Files was reached, as a root user,
	 sysctl -w fs.file-max=100000

	To persist these changes after reboot, edit /etc/sysctl.conf and add this parameter there

	- its firewall that allows system administrators to manage incoming and outgoing traffic
