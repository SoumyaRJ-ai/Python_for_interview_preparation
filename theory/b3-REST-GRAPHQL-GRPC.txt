- REST
	- REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer
	- It's principles are:
		- It should be stateless
		- It should access all the resources from the server using only URI
		- It does not have inbuilt encryption
		- It does not have session
		- It uses one and only one protocol - HTTP
		- For CRUD operations, it should use HTTP methods like
			GET  - to retrieve one or more records
			POST - to create record
			PUT  - to update an existing record
			PATCH- to update a specific column in existing record
			DELETE- to delete a record

			HEAD - response identical to GET, but without response body
			CONNECT- establishes a tunnel to server identifier by the target resource
			OPTIONS- used to describe the communication options for the target resource.
			TRACE- performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
			PATCH- used to apply partial modifications to a resource

		- response can be JSON or XML, atom, OData etc.

		Idempotence - If something is idempotent, then no matter how many times you do it, the result will always be the same.
		1. POST is NOT idempotent.
		2. GET, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE are idempotent.
		Nulipotent- GET is so because nothing is added or changed, except logging.

	- REST based vs RESTFUL
		- REST based services follow some of the above principles and not all
		- RESTFUL services means it follows all the above principles.
	- Richardson-maturity-model
		- to know level of RESTful your API is.
		- https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/09/13/know-how-restful-your-api-is-an-overview-of-the-richardson-maturity-model

	- Best practice for RESTful API design is that
		- path params are used to identify a specific resource or resources,
		  while query parameters are used to sort/filter those resources.
	- REST Design Patterns
		1) Layered Architecture
			- will improve system scalability and security
			- When client and server doesnt know about any intermediaries, we can place
			proxy or load balancer, and improve scalability.
			Also, adding separate layer of security enhances system safety
		2) Caching
			- results in low server latency, increase in app speed and responsiveness
		3) Stateless interactions
			- results in enhanced performance, app reliability
		4) Adding Common parameters to API, like
			Filtering - to filter the payload size, by filtering on multiple fields
				GET /users?age=30

			Pagination - will help, ease the burden of overloading either client or server
				- Also, previous and next page links can be provided in the link
				GET /users?page=3&results_per_page=20

			Sorting - will help to sort the payload based on one or more fields
				GET /users?sort_by=first_name&order=asc



REST vs SOAP
=============
RESTful supports JSON, XML,
	SOAP supports only XML
REST is faster than SOAP based web services
	SOAP is more secure
REST allows a greater variety of data formats,
	SOAP only allows XML.

1) SOAP
	- Communication happens using XML only
	- Request is sent to SOAP methods
	- Documentation is in WSDL (Wizdal)
	- Heavy, more secure, more stable
	- getting less popular
2) REST API
	- Communication happens using Json, XML
	- Requests are sent to API methods/urls using
	- Communication happens in HTTP(Internet)
	- Lightweight, stable
	- Easy to develop and automate
	- very popular

Authentication vs authorisation
================================
	- Authentication is validating the user.
	- Authorization is Validating the role of valid user.
	- Simple Analogy is that in the company office only employees (means valid people) can enter.
		But only few people can access secured rooms.

API Authentication
===================
	1) HTTP Authentication
		- Basic HTTP Auth
			- where we send credentials to server, in http header. so less secure.
		- Bearer HTTP Auth
			- where we send a token to the server. Eg: Authorization: Bearer <Token>
		- JWT (Json Web Token)
			- It gives user-level access
			- Also, contains additional information like expiration date, user's uniqueID, ...
	2) API Keys
		- its a long unique code used to access APIs
		- used for both authentication of users and tracking usage statistics.
	3) OAuth
		- provides a way for users to grant 3rd party access to their web resources
		  without sharing their passwords.
		- oauth providers can be social logins like facebook, google, twitter, ...
		- Also, we can create using AWS Cognito

		openID - facebook, google, twitter, etc

OAuth
======
	OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that provides applications the ability for “secure designated access.”
	OAuth doesn’t share password data but instead uses authorization tokens to prove an identity between consumers and service providers.

	OAuth is about authorization and not authentication. Authorization is asking for permission to do stuff. Authentication is about proving you are the correct person because you know things. OAuth doesn’t pass authentication data between consumers and service providers – but instead acts as an authorization token of sorts.

	OAuth transaction has THREE parts - the user, the consumer, and the service provider.

	Ex: If user wants to access a website using Oauth Provider, like facebook.

	Step 1: User will come to the website, click on facebook login.
	Step 2: The application will redirect the user, to facebook for authorization.
	Step 3: Facebook, which is the Oauth provider, will validate the user, and the website too.
		Means Invalid user cant access the website.
		Also, user is protected from accessing a Phising Website( which is similar to Original Website)

		Finally, after validation, Oauth provider will reply token, with some expiry time.
	Step 4: So, from then, user will access the website using that token, for the given time.

OAuth vs OAuth2
===============
	OAuth 2.0 is a complete redesign from OAuth 1.0, and the two are not compatible.
	OAuth 1.0 is deprecated now.

	OAuth 2.0 is faster and easier to implement.
	OAuth 1.0 used complicated cryptographic requirements, only supported three flows, and did not scale.

	OAuth 2.0 has six flows for different types of applications and requirements and enables signed secrets over HTTPS.
	OAuth tokens no longer need to be encrypted on the endpoints in 2.0 since they are encrypted in transit.


SAML
====
	SAML means Security Assertion Markup Language
	It is an alternative federated authentication standard that many enterprises use for Single-Sign On (SSO).
	SAML enables enterprises to monitor who has access to corporate resources.

SAML vs OAuth
=============
	SAML uses XML to pass messages, and OAuth uses JSON.
	OAuth uses API calls extensively, so, suitable for mobile applications, modern web applications, game consoles, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
	Whereas SAML drops a session cookie in a browser that allows a user to access certain web pages - great for short-lived web pages.


OAuth vs JWT
============
	- OAuth 2.0 defines a protocol, i.e. specifies how tokens are transferred,
	  JWT defines a token format.
	- OAuth 2.0 and "JWT authentication" have similar appearance when it comes
	  to the (2nd) stage where the Client presents the token to the Resource Server:
	  the token is passed in a header.
	- But "JWT authentication" is not a standard and does not specify how the Client
	  obtains the token in the first place (the 1st stage).
	  That is where the perceived complexity of OAuth comes from: it also defines
	  various ways in which the Client can obtain an access token from something
	  that is called an Authorization Server.
	- So, JWT is just a token format, OAuth 2.0 is a protocol (that may use a
	  JWT as a token format).


JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
	- It is just a token format. JWT tokens are JSON encoded data structures contains
	information about issuer, subject (claims), expiration time etc.
	- It is signed for tamper proof and authenticity and it can be encrypted to
	protect the token information using symmetric or asymmetric approach.
	- JWT is simpler than SAML 1.1/2.0 and supported by all devices and it is more
	powerful than SWT(Simple Web Token).

OAuth2
	- OAuth2 solve a problem that user wants to access the data using client
	 software like browse based web apps, native mobile apps or desktop apps.
	- OAuth2 is just for authorization, client software can be authorized to
	 access the resources on-behalf of end user using access token.

OpenID Connect
	- OpenID Connect builds on top of OAuth2 and add authentication.
	- OpenID Connect add some constraint to OAuth2 like UserInfo Endpoint,
	  ID Token, discovery and dynamic registration of OpenID Connect providers
	  and session management.
	- JWT is the mandatory format for the token.

CSRF protection
	- we don't need implement the CSRF protection if you do not store token
	  in the browser's cookie.



REST features
=============
	- Performance
		— best suited for systems requiring rapid iteration and HTTP standardized verbiage,
	- Scalability
		— allows the support of large numbers of components and interactions among them,
	- Simplicity
		— REST has a uniform interface which simplifies and decouples the architecture,
	- Modifiability
		— components can be modified to fit changing needs even while the application is running.


GraphQL features
================
	- Adaptability
		— the client decides what data they want, how they want it and what format they
          want to get it in,
	- Efficiency
		— delivers exactly what the client requests without over fetching,
	- Flexibility
		— GraphQl is cross-platform and supports more than a dozen languages (Perl, Java,
          Python, PHP among others).

	- My experince
		- worked with GraphQL using AWS AppSync, and with python module, strawberry-graphql
	- Why GraphQL
		- when we give REST API, if the user is interested in part of data from, say,
		  three endpoints, then they will collective all the data and filter what they need
		- It is resource exhaustive from both serving and consuming sides.
		- If the user has the flexibility to customize the feed as per their need, then
		  we can exactly send the data, as needed.
		- That is the main reason for moving from REST API, to GraphQL

GRPC features
=============
	- Lightweight and quick system for requesting data
	- RPC functions on contracts, the negotiation is defined by the relationship
    	between the server and the client not by the architecture.
	  Most of the power relies on the client-side while handling and computations
	  are offloaded to a remote server hosting the resource.

	- lightweight
		- requires very little resources which makes it a handy solution for even
		extremely low powered situations
	- efficient
		- gPRC uses protobufs, a method of serializing structured data which focuses
		on serializing communication in an effective manner
	- open-source
	- Mainly suited for systems where requester is low power or want to preserve resources.
	- suitable for IoT devices like voice controllers, smart light switches,
	  smock alarm locks, cameras.


MicroService vs Web Service
----------------------------
	- microservice is a small, independent, application that performs a highly focused service
	  as well as possible.
	- web service is an internet-based interface that makes the "services" of one application
	  available to applications running on different platforms.
