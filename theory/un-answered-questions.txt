Creating
Framework to choose – django rest framework or flask_restplus
AUthentication mechanism
Oauth
JSon web token
Django based token authentication
Web based session authentication
Authorization
Role based
Or policy based
Designing the endpoints
Dataset to expose and method involved


copy vs deep copy

------
recent feature that you have built, try to show the feature in action and answer the following questions:

What feature did you need to implement?
Technically, from a high level how did you implement this? How long did it take?
What were some initial challenges or things that you needed to think about?
How did you overcome these challenges?

----------
how to motivate
SQLAlchemy - Traditional and Declarative mapping

How to you ask suggestions from the clients

solid design principles explanation


functional programming in python


Asyncio vs multithreading vs multiprocessing
Summary
Concurrency Type	Features
Multiprocessing		Multiple processes, high CPU utilization.
Threading			Single process, multiple threads, pre-emptive multitasking, OS decides task switching.
AsyncIO				Single process, single thread, cooperative multitasking, tasks cooperatively decide switching.


requirement gathering  process

a= 1
d1 = {a: 'sad'}

a = 2
d1[a]

How to manage conflicts

- namespaces
	LEGB - Local, Enclosed, Global, Builtin scopes

Lst comprehension
	[i for i in range(10)]
	Last value is i is 9
	Outside if you print(i)

Local scope – anothing defined in function

Global – at the script level

staticmethod vs classmethod

Internal product teams

That is into insurance related analytics

Here, ww get the personal profiling of the people
	Say , we will get the heart rate, bp, liek that medical measurements

We wil profile them and

It is flask application
Mongodb is database

They have no sql database – django doesnt work with it
