Git Commands
============
- git commit vs git push?
	git commit  - puts your changes into your local repo,
	git push    - sends your changes to the remote location.

- git fetch vs git pull?

	git pull pulls down from a remote and instantly merges.
	git fetch is similar to pull but doesn't merge.

	git fetch - tells your local git to retrieve the latest meta-data info from the original
					(yet doesn't do any file transferring. It's more like just checking to see if
					there are any changes available).
	git pull  - does git fetch AND brings (copy) those changes from the remote repository.

- Git merge vs git rebase

	Git rebase and merge both integrate changes from one branch into another.
	Git rebase moves a feature branch into a master. Git merge adds a new commit, preserving the history.

	Merge: Moves changes from a branch to another and creates a merge commit.
	History is preserved.
		(Feature branch context) When to Merge: Merge if target branch has no changes.

	Rebase: Moves changes from a branch to another but alters the history by moving
	the origin branch's starting point. It does not create a merge commit.

	(Feature branch context) When to Rebase: Pull and rebase if there are changes on target branch.

- To remove unstage files,
	git reset HEAD -- path/to/file

- git bisect
	- to discover the commit that has introduced a bug in the code

- To squash (merge) last three commmits
	git reset --soft HEAD~3 &&
	git commit

	To update the commit message,
		git commit --edit -m"$(git log --format=%B --reverse HEAD..HEAD@{1})"

- "git blame" shows line by line `last` commit history of a file,
		when and by whom the line was updated

- Stashing
	- To manage the temporary code, we can use git stashing
		- For single stash,
			git stash  --> will save current uncommitted changes
			git stash pop --> will restore saved uncommitted changes

			git stash save 'add: something' --> adds a tag for saved uncommitted changes, such that we can restore specifically
			git stash list      --> will list all the saved stashes
			git stash apply 0   --> will restore the 0th index stash
