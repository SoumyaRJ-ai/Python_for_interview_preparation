# When we are building complex programs, or just a library of useful code
# for other programmers to use as part of their programs, we write our code
# as functions. When you define a function, you tell what parameters it takes,
# followed by a code block telling what you do with those parameters.

# Factorial of n is the product of positive integers up to n.

# The return statement at the end of the function is used to tell what the
# function gives back to whoever calls it. Now we can invoke our function
# wherever we want, for whatever parameter values we wish, as if the Python
# language itself had been extended to have the factorial function:

print(factorial(5))
print(factorial(10))
print(factorial(100))

# The docstring is automatically placed in object under name __doc__
print(factorial.__doc__)

# Note that def is a statement just like any other, so that the previous
# function calls would not have worked before the def was executed. In a
# sense, def is really an assignment that assigns the function name to a
# function object, as opposed to a string or an integer. The function names
# are variables, just like any other variables, and could be later be
# assigned to point some place else.
