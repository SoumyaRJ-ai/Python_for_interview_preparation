Purpose:
    Two sorted arrays (ascending) are given one of size x, one of size y.
    Third empty array is provided of size x+y
    Can you merge elements of both arrays to the third array such that, that is also sorted in ascending order?
    E.g.
        Array1: 1,3,5,7,9
        Array2: 2,4,6,8,10
        Should give: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
    E.g2:
        Array1: 1,100
        Array2: 2,4,6,8,10
        Should give: 1,2,4,6,8,10,100
