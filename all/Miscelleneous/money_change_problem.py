Purpose: Money change problem
Q) Convert some amount of money into given denominations, using the smallest
possible number of coins.

Input: An integer money and an array of d denominations c =(c1, c2, ....., cd),
       in decreasing order of value (c1 > c2 > ··· > cd).
Output: A list of d integers i1,i2,...,id such that c1 · i1 + c2 · i2 +
        ··· + cd · id = money; and i1 + i2 + ··· + id is as small as possible.
