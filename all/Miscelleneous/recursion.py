# Well, that was nothing much to write home about, since we already did
# that with iteration. However, it turns out that in theory, what you
# can do with recursion you can also do with iteration, and vice versa.
# However, in practice one of the techniques can be vastly superior for
# some problems. Here are a couple of example problems where the recursive
# solution is far simpler and easier than the iterative one. First, the
# classic Towers of Hanoi puzzle.
