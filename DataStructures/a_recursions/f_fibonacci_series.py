Purpose: Fibonacci series Generation
    - first two numbers are 0 & 1
    - each next number is a summation of previous two nums
    - fib numbers - 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, .....
      positions   - 0  1  2  3  4  5  6   7 .....

Q) Get the first 10 fib series numbers
Q) Get the 11th fib series number
